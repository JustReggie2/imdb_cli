# ImdbCli

A CLI for IMDB Trailers page, that will scrape the current most popular trailers and provide Top 10, 25, and 50 list. Once you have list you will be able to delve further to see more information on the movie along with link to watch trailer.

# Motivation

I enjoy movie or show trailers immensely and thought this would be a good first project.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'imdb_cli'
```

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install imdb_cli

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
